kingfish-galaxies
=================

A web app which displays the galaxies from the KINGFISH survey of the Herschel Space Observatory.

You can see an example of this in use at http://herschel.cf.ac.uk/kingfish

The positioning of the galaxies in the image, and other information is stored in galaxy_data_radec-wikisky.csv.

The python script makehtml.py then constructs the HTML file kingfish.html. A sensible future update would be to convert to a json file and read the information using javascript instead...
